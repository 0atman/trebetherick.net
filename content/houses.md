Having stayed at The Haven in the early days and rented Linkside in subsequent summers, Ernest Betjemann decided in 1928 to build his own house in Trebetherick. Undertown was designed by the architect Robert Atkinson with an Arts and Crafts flavour.
Atkinson was also responsible for the design of Grey Ladies and Grey Gables, as well as houses in The Close.
