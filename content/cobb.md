- 1780-1838 - Cobb Cottage
Cobb Cottage was standing at the end of a row of 6 cottages extending down the lane. There was a gap, and then 2 more cottages, which now are incorporated in “Torquil Cottage”. The row of 6 cottages all had their backs to the lane, and a path ran from the present Undertown drive serving all their entrance doors. They were turned to the south and away from the lane for maximum sun and warmth on their gardens. In 1840 Nancy Kent was living in Cobb Cottage, a nearby field is known still as Nancy’s Meadow.  The other five cottages were then occupied by William Mably, Robert Mably, Aaron Slogett and John Kent. The centre cottage of the 6 was used in 1838 for housing the rocket apparatus used by the coastguards. By 1880 there is only one of the row of cottages left, Cobb Cottage.

- St Enodoc Cottage

St Enodoc Cottage was built in 1826 and is here today, unchanged.  It was built by Theophilus Hoskin, and was occupied in the early 1900s by Captain Faulkner. Cobb Cottage seems to have been tied to St Enodoc Cottage either as a gardener’s cottage or an annexe. John Betjeman recounted that the first German spy to be captured during the First World War was arrested there after local people reported having seen smoke rising from the chimney of the unoccupied cottage; he had come off a submarine in Daymer Bay.
