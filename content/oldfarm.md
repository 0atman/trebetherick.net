# The Old Farm of today began life being called Higher Farm.
- In 1851 William Mably was a farmer who owned Higher Farm and 94 acres of land. He lived with his wife, 5 adult children and 2 grandsons.
 In 1851 he was 61 years old and farmed 94 acres with the help of 1 labourer. His eldest son Robert, who was living with him, was aged 36 and widowed and perhaps he had gone back to his old home so that grandmother could help to look after his two sons William and Gregory, then aged 8 and 6. 

- In 1929 the old house was renamed “Old Farm” when it was split up from its land, the land and a new farmhouse retained the name Higher Farm. More detailed information and name change in the LOCAL AREA section HISTORY page.
