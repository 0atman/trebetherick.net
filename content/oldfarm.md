# The Old Farm of today began life being called Higher Farm with 94 acres.
- 1851 William Mably was a farmer who owned his own house and land. He lived with his wife, 5 adult children and 2 grandsons in the Higher Farmhouse, renamed “Old Farm”in 1930. In 1851 he was 61 years old and farmed 94 acres with the help of 1 labourer. His eldest son Robert, who was living with him, was aged 36 and widowed and perhaps he had gone back to his old home so that grandmother could help to look after his two sons William and Gregory, then aged 8 and 6.
