While a wealth of historical information about Trebetherick has always existed, there hasn't been a single, publicly accessible place for it to be safely stored and displayed for everyone to view and enjoy, until now.
We invite you to explore the Trebetherick Museum and discover the fascinating history of our area.

### Background

The site was conceived by Trebetherick residents, Jenny & Brian Oaten. Their son, Tristram, a web developer, built this digital museum for the entire community to use, contribute to and enjoy. Brian's parents, Mabyn and Lewis Oaten, born in St Mabyn and St Kew, lived in Trebetherick from 1938. The Oaten family‚Äôs roots in these villages can be traced back to 1781, with earlier generations recorded in neighbouring parishes.

This website is currently in its infancy, and we are relying on your [submissions](mailto:contact@trebetherick.net) of stories and pictures to help it grow. As new pages are added, they will be listed on the front page. The only house featured at the moment is our entry for The Haven, the Oatens' family home until 2000 (when we moved next-door). We hope that soon there will be many other pages for houses, farms, shops, St Enodoc Church - anything in and around Trebetherick.

### How is the site built?

We are using GitHub.com to make the website because it enables us to keep everything safe, organized, and easy to update.

#### GitHub?

GitHub is the largest, most trusted web-based collaboration platform in the Web world. It allows us to review changes, discuss issues, and manage projects in one place.

Launched in 2008, and bought by Microsoft in 2018, GitHub has become foundational infrastructure of the Internet. By storing our important information and photos with GitHub, we can be sure that this legacy will last for as long as possible.

In simple terms:

üß∫ GitHub is like an online vault for our website. It keeps all the pictures, history, and stories in one safe place. It keeps track of every change we make. If a mistake is made, we can go back to an older version, just like keeping a copy before trying something new.

üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Other people can help. If someone from the village wants to add a photo or text, we can do it through GitHub easily. Just email it to us, link below, and we will give it its own page in the museum. (For those of a technical background, we also accept GitHub PRs directly)

üåç GitHub hosts the website for free, and all the documents and photos are available to the public for free, forever. Anyone can visit and see our museum's story online.

### Contributing

We would be delighted if you have information, and/or photographs that you would like to submit for preservation in the Trebetherick Museum, [please email it to us at contact@trebetherick.net](mailto:contact@trebetherick.net)
Please include as much accurate information and names as possible about every submission.
Please submit your photos in as high a quality as you can, original resolution ideally, and be aware that apps like WhatsApp reduce the quality of photos without asking (ask for originals by email, if you have been sent photos through WhatsApp).
