We are using GitHub to make our TREBETHERICK MUSEUM website because it enables us to keep everything safe, organized, and easy to update.

🧺 GitHub is ​like a storage cupboard for our website. It keeps all the pictures, history and stories in one safe place on the internet.
🧶 It remembers every change we make. If I make a mistake, I can go back to an older version, just like keeping a copy of a knitting pattern before trying something new.
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Other people can help. If someone from the village wants to add a photo or text, we can do it through GitHub easily.​ Just email it to us, link below, and we will enter it into the museum.
🌍 It can show our website to the world for free. GitHub will actually host the site, so anyone can visit and see our museum’s story online.
GitHub is the largest cloud-based platform available that hosts Git repositories and adds collaboration tools on top of Git. It allows ​us to review changes, discuss issues, and manage projects in one place. GitHub ​Git is an open-source, free version control system that offers a free tier that gives access ​to unlimited public and private repositories t​o use as ​a resource​.
