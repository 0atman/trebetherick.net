Trebetherick is between Polzeath and Rock, the lower area extending west to Daymer Bay, St Enodoc Church and Trebetherick Point and
Higher Trebetherick the top area of Flo's Deli Cafe General Stores, the Rocket House, Fore Dore and Worthy Hill.

We are excited to announce the launch of the Trebetherick Museum, a new digital platform dedicated to preserving and showcasing the rich historical information about our beloved Trebetherick.
While a wealth of historical information about Trebetherick has always existed, there hasn't been a single, publicly accessible place for it to be safely stored and displayed for everyone to view and enjoy‚Äã, until now. Our son, Tristram Oaten, a talented web developer and software engineer, has designed and created this digital museum for the entire community to use‚Äã, to contribute and enjoy.

We invite you to explore the Trebetherick Museum and discover the fascinating history of our area. It is currently in its infancy, and we are relying on your submissions of stories and pictures to help it grow. As new pages are added, they will be listed on the front index page. The only house featured at the moment is our entry for The Haven, our family home until 2000. We hope that soon there will be many other pages for houses, farms, shops, St Enodoc Church‚Äîanything in Trebetherick.

ABOUT THE TREBETHERICK MUSEUM WEBSITE  - trebetherick.net 
We are using GitHub to make our TREBETHERICK MUSEUM website because it enables us to keep everything safe, organized, and easy to update.

üß∫  GitHub is ‚Äãlike a storage cupboard for our website. It keeps all the pictures, history and stories in one safe place on the internet. It remembers every change we make. If a mistake is made, I can go back to an older version, just like keeping a copy before trying something new. 
üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë  Other people can help. If someone from the village wants to add a photo or text, we can do it through GitHub easily.‚Äã Just email it to us, link below, and we will give it its own page in the museum.
üåç  It can show our website to the world for free. GitHub will actually host the site, so anyone can visit and see our museum‚Äôs story online.

GitHub is the largest cloud-based platform available that hosts Git repositories and adds collaboration tools on top of Git. It allows ‚Äãus to review changes, discuss issues, and manage projects in one place. GitHub ‚ÄãGit is an open-source, free version control system that offers a free tier that gives access ‚Äãto unlimited public and private repositories t‚Äão use as ‚Äãa resource‚Äã.
