<img width="50%" alt="Elm Cottage.jpg" src="/Elm Cottage.jpg" />

- Elm Cottage - in 1851 was a Farm of 40 acres
John Mably was a widower farming 40 acres for which he needed 2 labourers. His unmarried daughter Caroline lived with him, and he had a 17 year old girl servant and a 19 year old male labourer living in his household. He lived in and owned the house now called “Elm Cottage”, surrounded then by farm buildings and pond with a well in the corner of the “courtlage” or farmyard.

- in 1970 Elm Cottage and its Piggary Elmside was no longer a working farm and was sold.
Elm cottage had been used for animals below and living accommodation upstairs with Elmside nextdoor used as a piggery.
