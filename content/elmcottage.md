John Mably was a widower farming 40 acres for which he needed 2 labourers. His unmarried daughter Caroline lived with him, and he had a 17 year old girl servant and a 19 year old male labourer living in his household. He lived in and owned the house now called “Elm Cottage”, surrounded then by farm buildings and pond with a well in the corner of the “courtlage” or farmyard.
