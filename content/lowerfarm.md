# 1851 - Lower Farm - 90 acres
- Thomas Arthur aged 61 farmed here with 90 acres, and had 2 labourers and a domestic servant living in the house, as well as his wife and 3 sons, one of whom was sadly deaf and dumb. Thomas Arthur rented his house and land, and he had also rented 2 other properties in Trebetherick, described as dwelling houses, but which by 1838 had ceased to be farm houses, although still surrounded by what had been their farmyards. Perhaps he sub-let them to his farm labourers. One has now completely disappeared under the Fore Door Garage site. In the farmyard there was a well, some 50 yards from the road, and there were a few farm buildings left.
