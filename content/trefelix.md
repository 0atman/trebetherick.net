- ​Trefelix was built in 1927 by Sir John and Lady Walsham upon their retirement from China. They were long-time visitors to Trebetherick, as Lady Walsham’s sister, Ursula Warren, lived at Torquil with Elsie McCorkindale. During a visit to the Walshams in China, Miss McCorkindale acquired a significant collection of Chinese porcelain and rugs.​ John Walsham, born in 1910, married Sheila Bannerman, daughter of Commander Bertram "Bertie" Bannerman. Commander Bannerman eventually moved to Rock, where he built and operated the Dormy House Hotel (now Lowenna Manor). John and Sheila had three children—Tim, Susan, and Jane—while John ascended the Royal Navy ranks to become Admiral Superintendent of Portsmouth Dockyard.
In 1949, John inherited Trefelix and the baronetcy but sold the house to the Frys shortly after. During the 1950s, it was sold to Mr. and Mrs. Bill Harrison, who converted the attic into additional rooms and built Bay View on Worthy Hill for their staff. In the 1970s, the property passed to psychiatrist Sidney Gottlieb.
Trefelix returned to the Walsham family in 1983 when Susan and her husband, Christopher Harbour, purchased it. Christopher, who founded the British Universities North America Club (BUNAC), established a travel company in Wadebridge before his sudden passing in 1986.​ After a period spent running a hotel in Ireland with her second husband, Mike Robertson, Susan eventually returned to Trefelix​ where she restore​d the house to its former glory.
