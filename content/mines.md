## Trebetherick Mines
- 1861: Trebetherick Mine (Trewiston Mine) at Mine Field was closed, although it reopened briefly around 1900
- Trewiston Lead Mine: Historical records indicate a lead mine ("Trewiston") was located in this area, with a sett granted in 1875 for three fields known as Lower, Inner, and Middle Hobby-house.
- Location: This site is situated east of the road, roughly between Trebetherick and Trewint.
-  The area has seen significant development, with houses built over the former mining area. One house north of the footpath is named "Middle Hobby," and another is known as "Hobby Field".
