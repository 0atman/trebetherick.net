# St Moritz Hotel - Opened 1946

- St Moritz around 1950.
It became a home for children evacuated from Aldersbrook in East London in the late summer of 1943. and it housed about 25 school-aged evacuees with others going to places like Tristram House in New Polzeath where Joe went.
From comments on different Polzeath Walks posts I gather that staff members from Aldersbrook, including one known as Jane (actually Joan Bish), managed the St Moritz evacuees and a nurse Cloke or Cloak was in charge of the younger children at Tristram House.
St Moritz Court was once a local prep school. Later, the Underwood family owned and managed it as part of the original St. Moritz Hotel. The Bedwell family acquired 4 St Moritz Court when the Underwoods sold the hotel in 1978.
