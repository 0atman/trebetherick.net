# St Moritz Hotel - Opened 1946

## 1943 
St Moritz became a home for children evacuated from Aldersbrook in East London in the late summer of 1943. It housed about 25 school-aged evacuees with others going to places like Tristram House in New Polzeath.
- St Moritz Court was once a local prep school. Later, the Underwood family owned and managed it as part of the original St. Moritz Hotel. The Bedwell family acquired 4 St Moritz Court when the Underwoods sold the hotel in 1978.
