​THE TREBETHERICK CANNON

This 3 pounder gun was mounted in the Trebetherick Battery​ at Greenaway, 20 feet above the High Water Mark, on the East side of the Camel Estuary, as part of the defences of Padstow. It is very badly corroded as it was exposed to salt spray in every gale in the prevailing South West wind for at least 200 years.​ It is thought that the guns on their wheeled carriage may have been kept in St Enodoc Church to be rolled out and up onto Greenaway when needed.

The gun was brought up from the Battery in the early 1900's, by a farmer Mr.​ Barton, with his last load of shingle from Greenaway beach​. The gun was set on a concrete plinth ​at the ​south west corner of The Haven in Trebetherick​ in 1906.

​Brian Oaten kindly arranged with Tim Parr naval historian, for the gun​s safekeeping to be displayed ​at Prideaux Place, where it has been conserved and has now been mounted on a ​1600 replica "bed and bracket" carriage​, for display.

While the degree of corrosion makes it difficult to be precise about its date, or its history, based on its proportions and the shape of its trunnions it is considered likely that it was cast in the 16th century, and is therefore another early cast iron gun.

This gun, with the three "Finbankers, which lay in Pentire Farm, formed the Trebetherick battery, which was a part of the defences of the "Safe Haven" which was established in Padstow, in 1780, to shelter British ships being pursued by American Privateers, as described in the panel on the War of American Independence.
