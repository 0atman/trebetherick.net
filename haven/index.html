<p>In 1906, The Haven was the first house constructed in Trebetherick, which was not directly linked to agriculture. Trebetherick was then primarily open farmland with only farm houses, farm workers and labourers cottages, smallholdings and barns. Following The Haven construction, other houses, guest houses, and eventually hotels were built in the area. The entrance pillars to The Haven, which now appear to be at an odd angle to the road, were built in 1906 and were perfectly parallel to the old road. In the 1960s, the Daymer Bay Garage was demolished allowing the old road to be improved, moved westward and straightened, the old road being left as the current layby.</p>

<p>Just above the Daymer Bay Garage was one of the village duck ponds ​which served as a watering spot for working horses, was drained in the 1930s after mains water was installed, making way for the ​new and larger Trebetherick telephone exchange. On the right is the gate into Ham Field, so called as it was the triangular shape of a ham.</p>

<p>The Daymer Bay Garage, was located at the junction of Worthy Hill and Daymer Lane, was operated by Norman Cleave, a motor car enthusiast and the father of Leadville Cleave and grandfather of Jon Cleave, from Port Isaac. The garage included workshops, garages, and a petrol pump. Norman also managed the Clock Garage at Rock.
Below the garage on Daymer Lane, Worthy House ​was built ​and served as both a Post Office and a telephone exchange, playing a central role in the village’s communication.</p>

It was mounted in the front garden until 1999, when Naval historian ​Tim Parr, who was researching Henrician Cannons, visited. He was instrumental in arranging for its preservation and subsequent display at Prideaux Place, where its sister cannon from the Padstow side is also located.</a></h2>
<p>THE TREBETHERICK CANNON - circa 16th centuary</p>
<p>This 3 pounder gun was mounted in the Trebetherick Battery at Greenaway, 20 feet above the High Water Mark, on the East side of the Camel Estuary, as part of the defences of Padstow. It is very badly corroded as it was exposed to salt spray in every gale in the prevailing South West wind for at least 200 years.​ It is thought that the guns on their wheeled carriage may have been kept in St Enodoc Church to be rolled out and up onto Greenaway when needed.</p>
<p>The gun was brought up from the Battery in the early 1900’s, by a farmer Mr.​ Barton, with his last load of shingle from Greenaway beach​. The gun was set on a concrete plinth ​at the ​south west corner of The Haven in Trebetherick​ in 1906.</p>
<p>​Brian Oaten kindly arranged with Tim Parr naval historian, for the gun​s safekeeping to be displayed ​at Prideaux Place, where it has been conserved and has now been mounted on a ​1600 replica “bed and bracket” carriage​, for display.</p>
<p>While the degree of corrosion makes it difficult to be precise about its date, or its history, based on its proportions and the shape of its trunnions it is considered likely that it was cast in the 16th century, and is therefore another early cast iron gun.</p>
